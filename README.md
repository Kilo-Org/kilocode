## 🌊 Vision

The CodeFlux AI Kit is more than a codebase—it’s a living stream.  
Its architecture flows like water: adapting, shaping itself to your project’s needs, and avoiding unnecessary resistance.

We draw from five Taoist precepts:

1. **Wu Wei** – Functions that work without unnecessary force, with natural defaults and graceful fallbacks.
2. **Ziran** – APIs that “just feel right” without rigid constraint.
3. **Yin–Yang** – Balanced design between speed and safety, sync and async.
4. **Empty Space** – Lean code with hooks for future growth and surprise integrations.
5. **Flow as Narrative** – A project that tells a coherent story from first commit to deployment.

## 🛠 Features

- **AI-Powered Utilities** – Modular, composable functions ready for natural integration.
- **Minimal Core, Infinite Extensibility** – Hooks and extension points for smooth evolution.
- **Narrative-Driven Architecture** – Readable, maintainable, and meaningful.
- **Balanced Performance** – Speed without sacrificing stability.
