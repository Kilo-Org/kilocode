  <h1>CodeAnywhere</h1>
  <p>A Web-Enabled AI Coding Platform Powered by Kilo Code</p>
</div>
<br/>

CodeAnywhere is an open-source project that builds upon the foundation of [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode) to provide a web-based AI coding platform with SaaS functionality. It allows you to leverage AI-powered code generation, task automation, and intelligent suggestions directly within your web browser, making coding accessible from anywhere.

While CodeAnywhere utilizes the core AI capabilities of Kilo Code, it extends the functionality with a web application interface and infrastructure for Software as a Service (SaaS) delivery.

**Key Features**

* **AI-Powered Code Generation (Web-Based):** Generate code from natural language descriptions directly within your web browser.
* **Automated Refactoring (Web-Based):** Refactor and improve existing code through the web interface.
* **Intelligent Code Completion (Web-Based):** Get smart suggestions as you type in the web editor.
* **Task Automation (Web-Based):** Automate repetitive coding tasks through the web application.
* **Cloud Accessibility:** Access your coding environment and AI assistance from any device with a web browser.
* **SaaS Functionality:** Built with a scalable architecture for potential multi-user support and subscription-based features.

**Get Started**

1.  Visit the [CodeAnywhere Web Application](**[Your Web App Link Here]**).
2.  Create an account or log in.
3.  Start coding with AI assistance directly in your browser!

**(Note:** The core AI engine is based on Kilo Code. You might find helpful information in the original Kilo Code documentation and community resources.)

**Local Setup & Development (for CodeAnywhere Platform)**

This section describes how to set up the development environment for the CodeAnywhere platform, including the web application and any backend services.

1. **Clone** this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone [Your CodeAnywhere Repo URL Here]
    ```
2. **Install dependencies** (This will likely involve different steps for the web app and backend):
    ```bash
    # Example for a Node.js web app
    cd web
    npm install

    # Example for a Python backend
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Adjust these commands based on your specific web application and backend technologies.)*

3. **Build** the web application:
    ```bash
    # Example for a React app using Vite
    cd web
    npm run build
    ```
    *(Adjust this command based on your web application's build process.)*

4. **Set up the backend services:** *(Provide instructions on how to set up and run your backend, including any database configurations or API keys.)*

5. **Run the web application and backend:** *(Provide instructions on how to start both the frontend and backend components of your CodeAnywhere platform.)*

**Note on the Original Kilo Code:**

CodeAnywhere is a fork of [Kilo Code](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode), an open-source AI agent extension for Visual Studio Code. If you are interested in using Kilo Code as a VS Code extension, please visit their [Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kilocode.Kilo-Code).

This README provides a starting point. You'll likely want to further customize it with more specific details about your "CodeAnywhere" project, such as the technologies you're using for the web app and backend, and more comprehensive setup instructions. Remember to replace the bracketed placeholders with your actual links and information.
