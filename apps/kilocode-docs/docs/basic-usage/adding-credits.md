# Adding More Kilo Credits

Once you've used any initial free Kilo Credits, you can easily add more:

- Add a credit card to your account (all payments are securely processed through Stripe)
- We don't currently offer a subscription, so you only pay for the credits you use, and only when you choose to top up your credits!
- Leverage your own API provider by [connecting your own API provider](/getting-started/connecting-api-provider.md)

## Transparent Pricing

At Kilo Code, we believe in complete pricing transparency:

- Our pricing matches the model provider's API rates exactly
- We don't take any commission or markup.
- $1 you give us becomes $1 of Kilo credits
- We debit your Kilo credits exactly what the provider charges us in dollars
- You only pay for what you use with no hidden fees

## Future Plans

We're continuously working to improve Kilo Code and expand our offerings:

- Additional LLM providers will be added in the future
- More payment options and other plans are under development
