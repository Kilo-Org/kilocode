# Kilo Code Documentation

Kilo Code **accelerates software development** with AI-driven code generation, intelligent automation, and deep codebase awareness — all inside VS Code.

It’s an open-source extension designed to help developers **move faster**, **reduce errors**, and **focus on real engineering problems**.

---

## Who Is Kilo Code For?

Kilo Code is built for developers and teams who want practical AI assistance, not generic chatbots.

- 💻 **Backend & Frontend Developers**
- 🏗️ **Tech Leads & Architects**
- 🧪 **QA & Automation Engineers**
- 📄 **Documentation & Platform Engineers**
- 🚀 **Startup Teams & Solo Builders**
- 🏢 **Enterprise Engineering Teams**

Whether you’re maintaining legacy systems or building from scratch, Kilo Code adapts to your workflow.

---

## What Can Kilo Code Do?

- 🚀 **Generate Code** from natural language descriptions
- 🔧 **Refactor & Debug** existing codebases
- 📝 **Write & Update** technical documentation
- 🤔 **Answer Questions** about your repository
- 🔄 **Automate** repetitive engineering tasks
- 🏗️ **Create** new files, modules, and projects

## How Kilo Code Works

Use [the chat interface](/basic-usage/the-chat-interface) to tell Kilo Code what you need.  
Behind the scenes, it uses **coding-optimized AI models**, project context, and controlled tools to execute tasks safely and effectively.

### Core Capabilities

- Understands your **entire project structure**
- Reads, writes, and modifies files with permission
- Executes real commands in your VS Code terminal
- Applies project-specific rules and instructions

---

## Example Prompt

Here’s what a real interaction looks like:

> **“Scan this repository and identify unused database indexes, then suggest PostgreSQL optimizations.”**

Kilo Code will:
- Search relevant files
- Analyze queries and indexes
- Propose optimizations
- Explain the reasoning step-by-step

---

## Using Kilo Code

### Multiple Modes

Kilo Code adapts to different tasks using specialized [modes](/basic-usage/using-modes):

- [**Code Mode (Default):**](/basic-usage/using-modes#code-mode-default)  
  General-purpose coding and implementation

- [**Architect Mode:**](/basic-usage/using-modes#architect-mode)  
  Planning, design decisions, and technical leadership

- [**Ask Mode:**](/basic-usage/using-modes#ask-mode)  
  Questions, explanations, and learning

- [**Debug Mode:**](/basic-usage/using-modes#debug-mode)  
  Systematic problem diagnosis and root-cause analysis

- **[Custom Modes](/agent-behavior/custom-modes):**  
  Create unlimited personas for security reviews, performance tuning, documentation, or any specialized workflow

---

### Core Tools

Kilo Code includes powerful [tools](/features/tools/tool-use-overview) that can:

- 📂 [Read](/features/tools/read-file), [write](/features/tools/write-to-file), and [delete](/features/tools/delete-file) files
- 🖥️ [Execute commands](/features/tools/execute-command) in your VS Code terminal
- 🌐 [Control a browser](/features/tools/browser-action)
- ❓ [Ask follow-up questions](/features/tools/ask-followup-question)
- 🔍 [Search your codebase](/features/tools/search-files)

See the full [Tools Reference](/features/tools/tool-use-overview) for details.

---

## Common Use Cases

- Generate APIs, services, and UI components
- Refactor legacy code safely
- Debug production issues step-by-step
- Write batch jobs, scripts, and cron tasks
- Analyze large monorepos efficiently
- Enforce coding standards with custom rules

---

## Extending Kilo Code

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **[MCP Overview](/features/mcp/overview)**  
  Add unlimited custom tools, integrate external APIs, connect databases, or build domain-specific development tooling.

### Local Models

- **[Local Models](/advanced-usage/local-models)**
