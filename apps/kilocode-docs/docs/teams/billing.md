# Billing & Credits

Kilo for Teams uses a transparent, two-part billing system: a monthly subscription for seats plus pay-as-you-go AI credits with zero markup.

## Understanding the Billing Model

### Monthly Subscription

- **$29 per user per month** for platform access
- **Billed monthly** on your signup anniversary
- **Pro-rated** for mid-cycle seat changes
- **Includes** dashboard access, team management, and all platform features

### AI Credits System

- **Pay exactly what AI providers charge** - no markup
- **Pre-purchase credits** to fund AI requests
- **Real-time deduction** as your team uses AI models
- **Transparent pricing** - see exact provider costs

## How AI Credits Work

### Credit Purchase Process

1. **Navigate to Billing tab** in dashboard
2. **Click "Buy Credits"**
3. **Select credit amount** ($50, $100, $250, $500, $1000+)
4. **Complete payment** using saved payment method
5. **Credits available immediately** for team use

### Credit Consumption

- **Per-request billing** - pay only for what you use
- **Model-specific rates** - different models have different costs
- **Token-based pricing** - input and output tokens counted separately
- **Real-time tracking** - see costs as requests happen

## Subscription Management

### Adding Seats

1. **Go to Subscriptions tab**
2. **Click "Add Seats"**
3. **Enter number of additional seats**
4. **Review pro-rated cost** for current billing cycle
5. **Confirm changes**

### Removing Seats

1. **Navigate to Subscriptions tab**
2. **Click "Remove Seats"**
3. **Select seats to remove** (must remove team members first)
4. **Review credit calculation** for remaining cycle
5. **Confirm reduction**

### Pro-Rating Calculations

- **Adding seats mid-cycle:** Pay proportional amount for remaining days
- **Removing seats mid-cycle:** Seat change will start at the next billing cycle
- **Billing date remains the same** regardless of seat changes
- **Next full cycle** reflects new seat count

## Invoice Management

### Monthly Invoices

Each invoice includes:

- **Subscription charges** for all seats
- **AI credit purchases** during billing period
- **Tax calculations** based on your location
- **Payment method** used for charges
- **Detailed line items** for transparency

### Downloading Invoices

1. **Access Billing tab**
2. **Find desired invoice** in history
3. **Click "Download PDF"**
4. **Save for expense reporting**

## Payment Methods

### Adding Payment Methods

5. **Save changes**

## Credit Management

### Monitoring Credit Balance

- **Real-time balance** shown in dashboard
- **Usage projections** based on team patterns
- **Low balance warnings** at 20% remaining
- **Automatic alerts** when credits run low

### Credit Expiration

- **Purchased credits never expire** - use them at your own pace
- **No monthly minimums** or usage requirements
- **Unused credits** carry forward indefinitely

## Billing Troubleshooting

### Failed Payments

If a payment fails:

1. **Check payment method** validity (expiration, limits)
2. **Update payment information** if needed
3. **Retry payment** manually in dashboard
4. **Contact support** if issues persist

### Billing Disputes

For billing questions:

1. **Review invoice details** in dashboard
2. **Check usage analytics** for the billing period
3. **Contact support** with specific questions
4. **Provide invoice number** and dispute details

### Service Suspension

If payment fails repeatedly:

- **3-day grace period** to resolve payment issues
- **Service suspension** after grace period expires
- **Data retention** for 30 days during suspension
- **Immediate restoration** upon payment resolution
