# Initial Concept

User downloaded "kilocode" from GitHub, applied 3 file corrections, and wants to build and install the CLI globally. The project is an AI autonomous agent for software development (TUI/CLI and VS Code extension).

# Product Definition

## Vision

Kilo Code aims to be the ultimate AI autonomous agent for software development, specifically empowering Open Source Maintainers to scale their impact. By automating complex coding tasks, context-aware code generation, and project maintenance, Kilo Code acts as a tireless co-maintainer, ensuring high-quality contributions and sustainable open-source ecosystems.

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** Open Source Maintainers.
- **Secondary:** Contributors to open-source projects and individual developers seeking productivity gains.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Automated Maintenance:** Reduces the toil of maintaining large codebases by automating documentation updates, changelog generation, and dependency management.
- **Quality Assurance:** Enforces project-specific coding standards and architectural patterns, acting as a first-pass reviewer for contributions.
- **Context-Aware Intelligence:** Understands the full project scope (monorepo, polyglot) to provide accurate, relevant code suggestions and refactorings.
- **Ubiquitous Access:** Available where developers work—VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, and the Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Coding Assistant:** Deep integration with IDEs to write, refactor, and fix code using advanced LLMs.
- **Terminal User Interface (CLI):** A powerful CLI tool for headless operations, scripting, and quick tasks without leaving the terminal.
- **Project Context Awareness:** "Memory" of project structure, conventions, and history to provide tailored assistance.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Seamless experience across VS Code, JetBrains, and terminal environments.

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in time spent on routine maintenance tasks.
- Increase in the velocity of accepted pull requests.
- Adoption rate among key open-source repositories.
