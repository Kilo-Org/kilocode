## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking.
Run `bd prime` for workflow context, or install hooks (`bd hooks install`) for auto-injection.

**Quick reference:**

- `bd ready` - Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` - Create issue
- `bd close <id>` - Complete work
- `bd sync` - Sync with git (run at session end)

For full workflow details: `bd prime`

## GitHub Workflow

- Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for interacting with GitHub (issues, PRs, reviews, releases) instead of the web UI when practical.
    - Examples: `gh issue list`, `gh issue view <id>`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr checkout <id>`, `gh pr review`.
- Sign any GitHub comments you leave (issues/PRs/reviews) with your Agent full name.
    - Example (end of comment): `— Agent Full Name`
- Sign your commits with your Agent full name.
    - Include a sign-off line in commits: `git commit -s ...` (adds `Signed-off-by: Agent Full Name`).

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
    ```bash
    git pull --rebase
    bd sync
    git push
    git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
    ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
