# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating comprehensive documentation for each core part of the codebase to help new developers understand the project structure, architecture, and development workflow. The documentation will serve as an onboarding guide and reference material for developers joining the project, covering the VS Code extension architecture, build system, testing framework, and key components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want comprehensive documentation about the codebase structure, so that I can quickly understand how the project is organized and where to find specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new developer accesses the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a clear overview of the project structure including all major directories and their purposes
2. WHEN a developer needs to understand component relationships THEN the system SHALL provide architectural diagrams showing how different parts interact
3. WHEN a developer looks for specific functionality THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation guides to locate relevant code sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want detailed documentation about the development workflow and build system, so that I can set up my development environment and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to build the project THEN the system SHALL document all build commands and their purposes
2. WHEN a developer wants to run tests THEN the system SHALL provide clear testing guidelines and commands
3. WHEN a developer needs to understand the CI/CD process THEN the system SHALL document the deployment and release workflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want documentation about the core components and their APIs, so that I can understand how to work with existing code and extend functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to understand the extension architecture THEN the system SHALL provide detailed documentation of the VS Code extension structure
2. WHEN a developer works with the webview UI THEN the system SHALL document the React/frontend architecture and component structure
3. WHEN a developer needs to understand services and utilities THEN the system SHALL provide API documentation for core services
4. WHEN a developer works with integrations THEN the system SHALL document external service integrations and their configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want coding standards and best practices documentation, so that I can write code that follows project conventions and maintains code quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer writes new code THEN the system SHALL provide coding style guidelines and conventions
2. WHEN a developer creates new components THEN the system SHALL provide architectural patterns and best practices
3. WHEN a developer needs to handle errors THEN the system SHALL document error handling patterns and logging practices
4. WHEN a developer adds new features THEN the system SHALL provide guidelines for testing and documentation requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want troubleshooting and debugging documentation, so that I can resolve common issues and understand debugging workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer encounters build issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guides for common problems
2. WHEN a developer needs to debug the extension THEN the system SHALL document debugging setup and techniques
3. WHEN a developer needs performance insights THEN the system SHALL document profiling and optimization approaches
