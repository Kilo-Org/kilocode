## I Want To Contribute

### Code Contributors

We‚Äôre excited that you‚Äôre interested in contributing code to Kilo Code! Before you start, please take a look at our [Development Guide](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md), it includes setup instructions, build steps, and details on running tests locally.

#### What to Expect

- A GUI-based change with settings may involve 12‚Äì13 files, plus about 18 more for internationalization (i18n).

- A new feature or major update might also require corresponding tests, translations, and settings configuration updates.

Don‚Äôt let that scare you off, we just want you to have a realistic idea of what‚Äôs involved before diving in. You‚Äôll learn a lot, and we‚Äôre here to help if you get stuck.

#### Tips Before You Start

- If your change affects any UI elements or Settings, expect it to touch multiple files and translations.

- You can use our translation workflow to automate adding i18n strings instead of editing each language manually.

Unsure if your contribution is ‚Äúsmall‚Äù or ‚Äúlarge‚Äù? Start a quick discussion in [kilo-dev-contributors](https://discord.com/channels/1349288496988160052/1391109167275577464) channel on discord or open an issue with good context, follow the commit and pull request guidelines below once you‚Äôre ready to open a PR.


### Reporting Bugs

Please use our issues templates that provide hints on what information we need to help you.

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [hi@kilocode.ai](mailto:hi@kilocode.ai).

### Custom Modes

Custom modes are a powerful way to extend Kilo Code's capabilities. To create and share a custom mode:

- Follow the [Custom Modes documentation](https://kilocode.ai/docs/features/custom-modes) to create your mode.

- Test your mode thoroughly

- Share your mode with the community by submitting a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/discussions).

### Feature Requests

Open an [Issue](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/issues/new/choose) only to suggest enhancement or reporting a bug. Don't open issues for questions or support, instead join our [Discord workspace](https://kilocode.ai/discord) and ask there.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.

### Improving The Documentation

If you notice outdated information or areas that could be clarified, kindly start a discussion in the [general](https://discord.com/channels/1349288496988160052/1349288496988160055) channel on discord.
Please note that the main [documentation](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/docs) repository has been archived, you can still view it for reference.

### Improving The Design

Design contributions are welcome! To ensure smooth collaboration, please use the Design Improvement Template when opening a design-related issue.
This helps us gather the right context (such as wireframes, mockups, or visual references) and maintain a consistent design language across the project. Feedback and iterations are highly encouraged, design is always a shared process.

### Publish a Blog Post or Case Study

We love hearing how people use or extend Kilo Code in their own projects. If you‚Äôve written about your experience, we‚Äôd be happy to feature it!
Our blog and case study repository has been archived, you can still access it [here](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/docs/tree/main/blog-posts) for reference. To share your work, please start a discussion in the [general](https://discord.com/channels/1349288496988160052/1349288496988160055) channel on discord,  summarizing your post or case study, with a link to the full content.

### Commit Messages

Writing clear and consistent commit messages helps maintainers understand the purpose of your changes. A good commit message should:

- Be written in the present tense (e.g., Add new feature, not Added new feature)

- Be short (50 characters or less for the summary line)

- Include additional context in the body if needed

- Reference related issue numbers (e.g., Fixes `#123)

- Keep each commit focused on one logical change


## Pull Requests

When you‚Äôre ready to contribute your changes, follow these steps to create a clear and reviewable pull request:

- Push your changes to your fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

- Open a Pull Request against the main Kilo Code repository.

- Select "Compare across forks" and choose your fork and branch.
