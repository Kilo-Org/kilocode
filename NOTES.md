Limitations:

- FastApply must be disabled.
- Generate Image probably doesn't work
- MCP servers dont work yet
- Does not respect context limits

Setup:

1.  Add a new provider profile of type Testing Tools
2.  Enter your model slug, BaseURL, API key.
3.  Check the box for "Use Full System Prompt" to retain access to custom modes, environment details, etc.
4.  Tools definitions are included by default in the tools definition field.  You probably shouldn't modify them, but if you do - you can.  Probably best to only modify descriptions.
5.  Give it a try!
