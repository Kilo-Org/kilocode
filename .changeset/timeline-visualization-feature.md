Add task timeline visualization to help you navigate chat history

We've added a new task timeline that gives you a visual overview of your conversation flow. You can click on timeline messages to quickly jump to specific points in your chat history, making it much easier to understand what happened during your session and navigate back to important moments.

This feature is available as a new setting in Display Settings. Enable it when you want that extra visibility into your task progress!
