# AI-Powered Git Commit Message Generation

Added a new feature that automatically generates meaningful Git commit messages using AI based on your staged changes.

## How It Works

1. Stage your changes in Git as usual
2. Click the sparkle (âœ¨) icon in the Source Control panel or run the "Generate Commit Message" command
3. The AI analyzes your staged changes and generates an appropriate commit message
4. The generated message is automatically populated in the commit input box
