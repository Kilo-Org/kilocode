Fix translation key mismatch for workflow access experimental setting

Changed translation key from RUN_SLASH_COMMAND to AUTO_EXECUTE_WORKFLOW to match the experiment constant. Updated name from "Enable model-initiated slash commands" to "Enable workflow access" and description to better reflect the feature's actual behavior of accessing workflow content without approval.
