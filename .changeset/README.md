# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `bun run changeset` in the root of the repository. This will prompt you to:

1. Select which packages should be updated
2. Choose the version bump type (major, minor, or patch)
3. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset file will be created in this directory and should be committed with your PR.

## How it works

1. When you create a PR with code changes, include a changeset describing the change
2. When PRs are merged to `dev`, the changeset-release workflow will create or update a "Version Bump" PR
3. When the Version Bump PR is merged, it will trigger a release with the generated changelog
