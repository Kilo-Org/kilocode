New: Inline Assist Commands

We've added two new commands that allow you to get AI assistance directly in the code editor. There's no need to start a whole new Kilo task if you just need a quick result. You can even use this while a task is running, speeding up your workflow!

‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Inline Tasks (Cmd/Ctl+I)
Only need a quick change? Select some code (or don't!) and hit Cmd+I. Describe your goal in plain English ("create a React component with these props", "add error handling to this function"), and get ready-to-use suggestions directly in your editor.

üß† Let Kilo Decide (Cmd/Ctl+L)
Think the change you need is obvious? Just hit Cmd+L. Kilo will use the surrounding context to offer immediate improvements, keeping you in the flow.

‚å®Ô∏è Live in Your Keyboard
Use your arrow keys (‚Üë/‚Üì) to cycle through the options and see a live diff of the changes. Happy with a suggestion? Hit Tab to apply it. That's it. No mouse needed.
