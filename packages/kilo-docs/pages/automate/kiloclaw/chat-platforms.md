# Connecting Chat Platforms

KiloClaw supports connecting your AI agent to popular messaging platforms. You can configure channels from the OpenClaw Control UI after accessing your instance.

## Supported Platforms

### Telegram

To connect Telegram, you need a **Bot Token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram.

Once configured, you can enter a new token to replace the existing one, or remove the connection entirely.

### Discord

To connect Discord, you need a **Bot Token** from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Slack

To connect Slack, you need **both** of the following tokens from [Slack App Management](https://api.slack.com/apps):

- **Bot Token** — starts with `xoxb-`
- **App Token** — starts with `xapp-`

Both tokens are required for the Slack integration to work.

## Configuring a Channel

1. Open the OpenClaw Control UI for your KiloClaw instance
2. Navigate to the **Channels** section
3. Enter the required token(s) for your platform
4. Click **Save**

Advanced settings such as DM policy, allow lists, and groups can be configured in the OpenClaw Control UI after connecting.

## Future Support

Additional platforms (such as WhatsApp) are planned for future releases. For the latest on supported platforms, refer to the [OpenClaw documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai).
