description: Using Kilo CLI in your browser.
---

Kilo CLI can run as a web application in your browser, providing the same powerful AI coding experience without needing a terminal.

## Getting Started

Start the web interface by running:

```bash
kilo web
```

This starts a local server on `127.0.0.1` with a random available port and automatically opens Kilo CLI in your default browser.

:::caution
If `KILO_SERVER_PASSWORD` is not set, the server will be unsecured. This is fine for local use but should be set for network access.

## Configuration

You can configure the web server using command line flags or in your [config file](/docs/config).

### Port

By default, Kilo CLI picks an available port. You can specify a port:

```bash
kilo web --port 4096
```

### Hostname

By default, the server binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only). To make Kilo CLI accessible on your network:

```bash
kilo web --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

When using `0.0.0.0`, Kilo CLI will display both local and network addresses:

```
  Local access:       http://localhost:4096
  Network access:     http://192.168.1.100:4096
```

### mDNS Discovery

Enable mDNS to make your server discoverable on the local network:

```bash
kilo web --mdns
```

This automatically sets the hostname to `0.0.0.0` and advertises the server as `kilo.local`.

### CORS

To allow additional domains for CORS (useful for custom frontends):

```bash
kilo web --cors https://example.com
```

### Authentication

To protect access, set a password using the `KILO_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variable:

```bash
KILO_SERVER_PASSWORD=secret kilo web
```

The username defaults to `kilo` but can be changed with `KILO_SERVER_USERNAME`.

## Using the Web Interface

Once started, the web interface provides access to your Kilo CLI sessions.

### Sessions

View and manage your sessions from the homepage. You can see active sessions and start new ones.

### Server Status

Click "See Servers" to view connected servers and their status.

## Attaching a Terminal

You can attach a terminal TUI to a running web server:

```bash
# Start the web server
kilo web --port 4096

# In another terminal, attach the TUI
kilo attach http://localhost:4096
```

This allows you to use both the web interface and terminal simultaneously, sharing the same sessions and state.

---

## Config File

You can also configure server settings in your `kilo.json` config file:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": 4096,
    "hostname": "0.0.0.0",
    "mdns": true,
    "cors": ["https://example.com"]
  }
}
```

Command line flags take precedence over config file settings.
