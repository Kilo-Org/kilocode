Request to switch to a different agent.

Available agents:
{agents}

When to switch:
- Switch to **code** when files need to be created, edited, or deleted - any implementation work
- Switch to **plan** when research, architecture, or planning is needed before implementation
- Switch to **debug** when systematically diagnosing issues, reproducing bugs, or tracing failures
- You have completed your part of the work and another agent should continue

Do NOT call this tool:
- If the task can be completed with your current agent
- To switch to your own agent (you're already using it)
- To delegate subtasks (use the task tool for that instead)
