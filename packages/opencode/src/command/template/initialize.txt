Please analyze this codebase and create an AGENTS.md file containing:
1. Build/lint/test commands - especially for running a single test
2. Code style guidelines including imports, formatting, types, naming conventions, error handling, etc.
3. Security guardrails: verify whether a pre-commit secret scan is configured, and document the setup (or recommended setup if missing)

The file you create will be given to agentic coding agents (such as yourself) that operate in this repository. Make it about 150 lines long.
If there are Cursor rules (in .cursor/rules/ or .cursorrules) or Copilot rules (in .github/copilot-instructions.md), make sure to include them.

If there's already an AGENTS.md, improve it if it's located in ${path}
When checking secret scanning, look for existing config in common places like:
- .pre-commit-config.yaml / pre-commit hooks
- husky or lint-staged pre-commit scripts
- gitleaks, detect-secrets, trufflehog, or equivalent scanners
If no secret scan is configured, include a concrete recommendation in AGENTS.md with commands/files to add for this repo.
