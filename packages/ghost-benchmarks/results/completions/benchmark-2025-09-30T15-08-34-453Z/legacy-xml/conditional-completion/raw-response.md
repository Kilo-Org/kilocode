I'll help complete the user access check by adding age verification logic based on the context showing a user object with an age property.

<change>
<search><![CDATA[    // Check if user is an adult
]]></search>
<replace><![CDATA[    // Check if user is an adult
    if (user && user.age >= 18) {
        return true;
    }
]]></replace>
</change>

This completion:
1. Checks if user object exists
2. Verifies user's age is 18 or above
3. Returns true if conditions are met
4. Falls through to return false (already present) if conditions fail
5. Matches the context of checking user access and age verification
