I'll help complete the imports needed for this React component that uses hooks.

<change>
<search><![CDATA[import ]]></search>
<replace><![CDATA[import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';]]></replace>
</change>

This completion:
1. Imports both useState and useEffect hooks that are being used in the component
2. Imports them from the 'react' package
3. Uses destructuring syntax which is the standard way to import React hooks
4. Matches the existing code style
