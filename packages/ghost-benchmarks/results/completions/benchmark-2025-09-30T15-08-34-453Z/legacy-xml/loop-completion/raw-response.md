I'll help complete the code to process each item in the array and add them to the results array.

<change>
<search><![CDATA[    // Process each item in the array
]]></search>
<replace><![CDATA[    // Process each item in the array
    for (const item of items) {
        results.push(item.toUpperCase());
    }
]]></replace>
</change>

This completion:
1. Uses a for...of loop to iterate through each item
2. Processes each item by converting it to uppercase
3. Adds the processed item to the results array
4. Matches the context of working with string items as shown in testItems
5. Follows the function's structure of building and returning results

The completed function will take strings like 'apple' and convert them to 'APPLE' in the results array.
