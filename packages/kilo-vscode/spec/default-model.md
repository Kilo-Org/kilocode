# Default Model

**Issue:** [#6074](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode/issues/6074)

## Settings

The Settings tab has a "Default model" picker. Whatever model is selected there is used as the starting model for every new session.

## New Session

When a new session is created, the model selector is pre-populated with the default model from Settings.

## Model Selector in Chat Input

Changing the model in the chat input changes it only for the current session. It has no effect on future sessions. The default in Settings remains unchanged.
