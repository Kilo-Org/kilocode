# Test Coverage Analysis for Autocomplete Repository

## Summary

After thorough analysis, the recommended test suite for the autocomplete-only repository should include:

‚úÖ **Autocomplete tests** (already in script)
‚úÖ **NextEdit tests** (needs to be added)
‚ùå **Other core tests** (not autocomplete-specific)

---

## Test Files Found

### 1. Autocomplete Tests ‚úÖ INCLUDE

**Location**: `core/autocomplete/**/*.vitest.ts`

Already covered by current test script: `npm run vitest -- autocomplete`

**Files**:

- `autocomplete/postprocessing/index.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/filtering/test/filter.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/filtering/streamTransforms/charStream.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/filtering/streamTransforms/filterCodeBlock.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/filtering/streamTransforms/lineStream.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/generation/GeneratorReuseManager.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/generation/ListenableGenerator.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/generation/utils.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/snippets/gitDiffCache.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/templating/__tests__/formatOpenedFilesContext.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/templating/__tests__/renderPrompt.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/util/completionTestUtils.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/util/processSingleLineCompletion.vitest.ts`
- `autocomplete/context/root-path-context/test/RootPathContextService.vitest.ts`

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Keep in test script** (already included)

---

### 2. NextEdit Tests ‚úÖ INCLUDE

**Location**: `core/nextEdit/**/*.vitest.ts`

NOT covered by current test script - needs to be added!

**Files** (8 total):

1. `nextEdit/DocumentHistoryTracker.vitest.ts`
2. `nextEdit/utils.vitest.ts`
3. `nextEdit/context/diffFormatting.vitest.ts`
4. `nextEdit/diff/diff.vitest.ts`
5. `nextEdit/templating/instinct.vitest.ts`
6. `nextEdit/templating/mercuryCoderNextEdit.vitest.ts`
7. `nextEdit/templating/NextEditPromptEngine.vitest.ts`
8. `nextEdit/templating/utils.vitest.ts`

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Add to test script**: `npm run vitest -- nextEdit`

---

### 3. LLM Tests ‚ùå DO NOT INCLUDE

**Location**: `core/llm/toolSupport.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Tests tool/function calling support for chat features (determining which LLM providers support function calling)

**Why exclude**:

- Not used by autocomplete or NextEdit
- Tool calling is for chat features (slash commands, context providers)
- Autocomplete uses LLMs for text generation only, not tool calling
- 352 lines testing various LLM provider capabilities for tools

**Recommendation**: ‚ùå **Exclude** - not autocomplete-related

---

### 4. Indexing Tests ‚ùå DO NOT INCLUDE

**Location**: `core/indexing/chunk/basic.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Tests code chunking for indexing/RAG features

**Why exclude**:

- Marked as `describe.skip` (not even running)
- Tests chunking logic for codebase indexing
- Autocomplete only uses `indexing/ignore.js` for security checks, not chunking
- Would need to keep entire indexing infrastructure just for these tests

**Recommendation**: ‚ùå **Exclude** - not running, not autocomplete-related

---

### 5. Utility Tests ‚ùå DO NOT INCLUDE

**Location**: `core/util/GlobalContext.test.ts`

**Purpose**: Tests global context storage (user preferences, telemetry settings, etc.)

**Why exclude**:

- Infrastructure/configuration management test
- Not autocomplete-specific functionality
- 327 lines testing file I/O and JSON parsing for settings
- If GlobalContext breaks, autocomplete tests would fail anyway

**Recommendation**: ‚ùå **Exclude** - infrastructure test, not feature-specific

---

## Recommended Test Scripts

### Option 1: Minimal Test Suite (Recommended)

**Focus**: Direct feature tests only

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on first error

pushd core
echo "üß™ Running Autocomplete Vitest tests..."
npm run vitest -- autocomplete

echo "üß™ Running NextEdit Vitest tests..."
npm run vitest -- nextEdit
popd

echo "üß™ Running VSCode unit tests..."
pushd extensions/vscode
npm test
popd

echo "‚úÖ All autocomplete and NextEdit tests passed!"
```

**Coverage**: ~24 test files (14 autocomplete + 8 NextEdit + 2 VSCode)

### Option 2: Extended Test Suite (Maximum Safety)

**Focus**: Feature tests + infrastructure tests

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on first error

pushd core
echo "üß™ Running Autocomplete Vitest tests..."
npm run vitest -- autocomplete

echo "üß™ Running NextEdit Vitest tests..."
npm run vitest -- nextEdit

echo "üß™ Running Infrastructure tests..."
npm run vitest -- core/util/GlobalContext
popd

echo "üß™ Running VSCode unit tests..."
pushd extensions/vscode
npm test
popd

echo "‚úÖ All tests passed!"
```

**Coverage**: ~25 test files (14 autocomplete + 8 NextEdit + 1 infrastructure + 2 VSCode)

**Recommendation**: Use **Option 1** unless you're particularly concerned about configuration storage.

See [`DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md`](DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md:1) for detailed reasoning on why Option 1 is sufficient.

## Test Coverage Strategy

### Philosophy

**Keep tests that directly verify autocomplete/NextEdit functionality.**

If a dependency breaks in a way that affects autocomplete:

1. The autocomplete tests will catch it ‚úÖ
2. If they don't catch it, we need better autocomplete tests
3. We don't need to test every dependency in isolation

### Benefits of Focused Testing

1. **Faster tests** - Only run what matters for autocomplete
2. **Clear scope** - Easy to understand what's being tested
3. **Easier maintenance** - Fewer tests to update
4. **Better signal** - Test failures directly indicate autocomplete issues

### What Gets Tested

- ‚úÖ Autocomplete completion generation
- ‚úÖ Autocomplete filtering and postprocessing
- ‚úÖ Autocomplete context retrieval
- ‚úÖ Autocomplete templating
- ‚úÖ NextEdit prediction logic
- ‚úÖ NextEdit formatting and diffing
- ‚úÖ VSCode extension integration

### What's Implicitly Tested (via autocomplete tests)

- LLM token counting (used by autocomplete)
- Tree-sitter parsing (used for context)
- Diff utilities (used by filtering)
- Markdown utilities (used by filtering)
- Config handling (used by CompletionProvider)
- Security checks (used by autocomplete)

---

## VSCode Extension Tests

The current script also runs: `cd extensions/vscode && npm test`

These test the VSCode-specific autocomplete integration:

- `extensions/vscode/src/autocomplete/__tests__/ContinueCompletionProvider.vitest.ts`
- `extensions/vscode/src/autocomplete/GhostTextAcceptanceTracker.vitest.ts`

**Recommendation**: ‚úÖ **Keep** - tests the VSCode integration layer

---

## Final Test Count

**Total tests to run**:

- ~14 autocomplete test files
- ~8 NextEdit test files
- ~2 VSCode extension test files
- **~24 test files total**

**Tests excluded**:

- 1 LLM tool support test (not autocomplete)
- 1 Indexing chunking test (skipped, not used)
- 1 Utility infrastructure test (not feature-specific)
- **3 test files excluded**

---

## Action Items

1. ‚úÖ Update `test-autocomplete.sh` to include NextEdit tests
2. ‚úÖ Verify all tests pass with updated script
3. ‚úÖ Use this test script throughout the cleanup process
4. ‚úÖ After cleanup, ensure test count hasn't accidentally decreased

---

## Dependency Test Analysis

See [`DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md`](DEPENDENCY_ANALYSIS.md:1) for comprehensive analysis of:

- Which dependencies have tests
- Whether those tests are autocomplete-relevant
- Risk assessment for untested dependencies
- Detailed recommendations with pros/cons

**Key Finding**: Most dependencies either have no tests OR have tests that aren't autocomplete-relevant (tool calling, RAG chunking). The one exception is `GlobalContext.test.ts` which tests configuration storage.

## Future Considerations

If after cleanup you discover autocomplete features breaking that weren't caught by tests:

1. Add tests to autocomplete or NextEdit test suites
2. Don't add dependency tests - improve feature tests instead
3. This keeps test scope focused and maintainable

**Exception**: If you find GlobalContext storage issues affecting autocomplete, consider adding its test (see Option 2 above).
