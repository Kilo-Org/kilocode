# Core Dependency Analysis - Phase 2

## Executive Summary

This analysis examined the Continue codebase by treating [`core/autocomplete/CompletionProvider.ts`](core/autocomplete/CompletionProvider.ts:1) and [`core/nextEdit/NextEditProvider.ts`](core/nextEdit/NextEditProvider.ts:1) as the primary entry points, along with all test files. The goal is to identify what code is actually used by the autocomplete and NextEdit features versus what can be safely removed.

**Key Findings:**

- **33 unused files** identified across config, control-plane, LLM, nextEdit, and utility directories
- **3 unused dev dependencies** that can be removed from package.json
- **228 unused exports** across many files (mostly in config, llm-info, and util directories)
- **134 unused TypeScript types**

**Overall Assessment:** The two features depend on a relatively small subset of the codebase. Significant portions of the config system, control-plane infrastructure, and various utilities are not used and can be removed.

## Entry Points Analyzed

### Primary Features

- [`core/autocomplete/CompletionProvider.ts`](core/autocomplete/CompletionProvider.ts:1) - Main autocomplete provider
- [`core/nextEdit/NextEditProvider.ts`](core/nextEdit/NextEditProvider.ts:1) - Main NextEdit provider (singleton pattern)

### Secondary Entry (Test Files)

- All `core/**/*.test.ts` files
- All `core/**/*.vitest.ts` files
- Note: `core/vscode-test-harness/` is explicitly excluded from this analysis per knip.json

---

## Knip Analysis Results

### Critical Dependencies (MUST KEEP)

These directories and files are actively imported and used by autocomplete/nextEdit:

#### Core Feature Directories

- ✅ **`core/autocomplete/`** - Primary autocomplete feature (entry point)
- ✅ **`core/nextEdit/`** - Primary NextEdit feature (entry point)
    - Note: Some files within nextEdit/context/ are unused (see unused files section)

#### Infrastructure (Required)

- ✅ **`core/llm/`** - LLM communication infrastructure

    - Used by both CompletionProvider and NextEditProvider
    - Includes OpenAI adapter, token counting, logging
    - Some files are unused (see unused files section)

- ✅ **`core/llm-info/`** - LLM provider metadata

    - Used for model detection and capabilities
    - One unused file: providers/vertexai.ts

- ✅ **`core/diff/`** - Diff utilities

    - Used by NextEdit for generating and applying diffs
    - All files appear to be used

- ✅ **`core/indexing/`** - File indexing and ignore patterns

    - [`isSecurityConcern()`](core/indexing/ignore.ts:261) function used by both features
    - Other functionality may be unused

- ✅ **`core/fetch/`** - HTTP fetching with certificate handling
    - Used by LLM providers for API calls
    - Appears fully utilized

#### Configuration (Needs Simplification)

- ⚠️ **`core/config/`** - Configuration system

    - [`ConfigHandler`](core/config/ConfigHandler.ts:1) is used by both main providers
    - Contains 8 unused files related to YAML parsing, onboarding, etc.
    - **Recommendation:** Replace complex config system with minimal hardcoded config objects

- ⚠️ **`core/config-types/`** - Configuration type definitions
    - Many unused schemas (50+ unused exports)
    - Only a small subset of types are actually used
    - **Recommendation:** Consolidate to only needed types

#### Utilities (Mixed Usage)

- ✅ **`core/util/`** - Shared utilities

    - [`DEFAULT_AUTOCOMPLETE_OPTS`](core/util/parameters.ts:1) used by both providers
    - Many other utility functions used
    - However, 50+ unused exports identified
    - **Recommendation:** Audit and remove unused utility functions

- ⚠️ **`core/utils/`** - Additional utilities (note: different from util/)

    - Markdown utilities appear to be used
    - **Recommendation:** Audit if this should be merged with core/util/

- ✅ **`core/test/`** - Test fixtures and utilities
    - Used by test files
    - Some setup files are unused (vitest.global-setup.ts, jest.global-setup.ts)

---

### Unused Directories (CAN REMOVE ENTIRELY)

These entire directories are not imported by autocomplete/nextEdit:

#### 1. **`core/control-plane/`** (8 files)

- **Purpose:** Telemetry, analytics, team features, authentication
- **Status:** NOT used by autocomplete or NextEdit
- **Recommendation:** ✅ **REMOVE ENTIRE DIRECTORY**
- **Files:**
    - `AuthTypes.ts`, `client.ts`, `env.ts`, `PolicySingleton.ts`, `schema.ts`, `TeamAnalytics.ts`
    - `analytics/` subdirectory
    - `auth/index.ts`
    - `mdm/` subdirectory

#### 2. **`core/codeRenderer/`** (1 file)

- **Purpose:** Code rendering/formatting utilities
- **Status:** NOT used by autocomplete or NextEdit
- **Recommendation:** ✅ **REMOVE ENTIRE DIRECTORY**
- **Files:** `CodeRenderer.ts`

#### 3. **`core/file:/`** (unknown purpose)

- **Purpose:** Unclear from name
- **Status:** Need to check if exists and if used
- **Recommendation:** Investigate and likely remove

#### 4. **`core/data/`** (2 files)

- **Purpose:** Dev data and logging SQLite infrastructure
- **Status:** Appears unused by features
- **Recommendation:** ⚠️ **Verify** - Check if logging is needed, otherwise remove
- **Files:** `devdataSqlite.ts`, `log.ts`

---

### Unused Files (Individual Files to Remove)

These specific files within otherwise-used directories are not imported:

#### Config System (8 files)

```
core/config/createNewAssistantFile.ts
core/config/onboarding.ts
core/config/yaml-package/cli.ts
core/config/yaml-package/scripts/generateJsonSchema.ts
core/config/yaml/default.ts
```

#### LLM System (8 files)

```
core/llm-info/providers/vertexai.ts
core/llm-info/util.ts
core/llm/defaultSystemMessages.ts
core/llm/llms/llmTestHarness.ts
core/llm/rules/rules-utils.ts
core/llm/streamChat.ts
core/llm/templates/edit/claude.ts
core/llm/utils/calculateRequestCost.ts
```

#### NextEdit Context (5 files - **SURPRISING**)

These files in `core/nextEdit/context/` are not imported despite being part of the NextEdit feature:

```
core/nextEdit/context/aggregateEdits.ts
core/nextEdit/context/autocompleteContextFetching.ts
core/nextEdit/context/prevEditLruCache.ts
core/nextEdit/context/processNextEditData.ts
core/nextEdit/context/processSmallEdit.ts
```

**Note:** This is unexpected and should be investigated. These may be dead code from refactoring.

#### Test Infrastructure (4 files)

```
core/__mocks__/@continuedev/fetch/index.ts
core/test/jest.global-setup.ts
core/test/vitest.global-setup.ts
core/test/vitest.setup.ts
core/vitest.config.ts
```

**Note:** These may be needed for test infrastructure even if not directly imported.

#### Test Fixtures (5 files)

```
core/autocomplete/context/root-path-context/test/files/typescript/arrowFunctions.ts
core/autocomplete/context/root-path-context/test/files/typescript/classes.ts
core/autocomplete/context/root-path-context/test/files/typescript/classMethods.ts
core/autocomplete/context/root-path-context/test/files/typescript/functions.ts
core/autocomplete/context/root-path-context/test/files/typescript/generators.ts
```

**Note:** These are test fixtures, not production code. Safe to remove if tests don't need them.

#### Utilities (3 files)

```
core/util/sentry/constants.ts
core/util/shellPath.ts
core/util/url.ts
```

---

### Unused Dependencies (Package.json)

The following dev dependencies can be removed:

```json
{
	"eslint-plugin-import": "package.json:17:6",
	"lint-staged": "package.json:19:6",
	"prettier-plugin-tailwindcss": "package.json:21:6"
}
```

---

### Unused Exports (228 total)

A large number of exported functions, classes, and constants are defined but never imported. Key categories:

#### 1. Language Info Constants (26 exports)

- File: [`core/autocomplete/constants/AutocompleteLanguageInfo.ts`](core/autocomplete/constants/AutocompleteLanguageInfo.ts:1)
- All individual language objects (Typescript, JavaScript, Python, etc.) are exported but only `LANGUAGES` array is used
- **Recommendation:** Make individual language objects non-exported, keep only `LANGUAGES` export

#### 2. Config Schemas (50+ exports)

- Files: `core/config-types/`, `core/config/yaml-package/schemas/`
- Extensive schema definitions that are unused
- **Recommendation:** Remove unused schemas when simplifying config system

#### 3. LLM Adapter Types (50+ exports)

- Files: `core/llm/openai-adapters/types.ts`, various LLM provider files
- Many adapter configurations and types are unused
- **Recommendation:** Keep only types/configs for providers actually used

#### 4. Utility Functions (50+ exports)

- Files: Throughout `core/util/`
- Many helper functions are unused
- Examples: Path helpers, message converters, TTS functions
- **Recommendation:** Remove unused utilities, consolidate remaining

#### 5. NextEdit Types (10+ exports)

- File: [`core/nextEdit/types.ts`](core/nextEdit/types.ts:1)
- Several interface definitions are unused
- **Recommendation:** Audit and remove unused type definitions

---

## Test Status

### Current Test Count

- **Core tests:** 445 tests passing
- **VSCode test harness:** 86 tests passing
- **Total:** 531 tests passing

### Expected After Phase 2

- **531 tests** - No change (this is analysis only, no code removal yet)

### Test Dependencies

All test files (`**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.vitest.ts`) are treated as entry points, so code they import is considered "used" even if not used by production features.

---

## Infrastructure Deep Dive

### What's Truly Needed

#### 1. LLM Communication (`core/llm/`)

**Keep:**

- OpenAI adapter and related code
- Token counting (tiktoken, llama tokenizer)
- LLM message formatting
- Basic LLM provider interfaces
- Completion streaming

**Can Remove:**

- Unused provider adapters (if any providers aren't used)
- Template system for chat/edit if not used by autocomplete/nextEdit
- Cost calculation utilities
- Rules system utilities

#### 2. Diff System (`core/diff/`)

**Keep:** Everything - appears fully utilized by NextEdit

- Myers diff algorithm
- Stream diff utilities
- Diff formatting

#### 3. Configuration (`core/config/`)

**Current State:** Complex YAML-based configuration system with many features

**What's Actually Needed:**

- Basic config object structure
- LLM provider configuration
- Autocomplete options
- NextEdit options

**Replacement Strategy:**

1. Create `core/autocomplete/MinimalConfig.ts` with hardcoded config
2. Create `core/nextEdit/MinimalConfig.ts` with hardcoded config
3. Remove entire YAML parsing infrastructure
4. Remove config schemas not needed for basic operation
5. Keep only minimal ConfigHandler interface if needed for testing

#### 4. Indexing (`core/indexing/`)

**Keep:**

- [`isSecurityConcern()`](core/indexing/ignore.ts:261) function
- Basic ignore pattern matching

**Evaluate:**

- Full indexing/walking infrastructure may not be needed
- Check if autocomplete/nextEdit actually need file system traversal

#### 5. Utilities (`core/util/` and `core/utils/`)

**Audit Required:**

- Keep only utilities actually imported by features
- Remove 50+ unused utility exports
- Consider merging `util/` and `utils/` directories

---

## Recommendations

### Phase 3 Prerequisites (Investigation Needed)

1. **NextEdit Context Files Mystery**

    - 5 files in `core/nextEdit/context/` are marked unused
    - Verify these are truly dead code from refactoring
    - Check git history to understand when they became unused

2. **Test Infrastructure Files**

    - Verify which test setup files are actually needed
    - May need to keep some even if not directly imported

3. **Data/Logging System**

    - Determine if any logging is needed for debugging
    - If not, remove `core/data/` entirely

4. **Indexing Usage**
    - Verify what parts of indexing are actually used
    - May only need security concern checking, not full traversal

### Safe to Remove Immediately (High Confidence)

#### Directories

- ✅ `core/control-plane/` - Telemetry/analytics (not needed)
- ✅ `core/codeRenderer/` - Not used by features

#### Individual Files

- ✅ Config onboarding/creation files
- ✅ Unused LLM provider files (vertexai)
- ✅ LLM cost calculation
- ✅ Sentry constants
- ✅ Test fixture files (if tests don't need them)

#### Dependencies

- ✅ `eslint-plugin-import`
- ✅ `lint-staged`
- ✅ `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`

### Requires Replacement Before Removal (Medium Effort)

#### Config System (`core/config/`, `core/config-types/`)

**Current:** Complex YAML parsing with extensive schemas

**Replacement Plan:**

1. Analyze what config fields CompletionProvider and NextEditProvider actually use
2. Create minimal config objects/interfaces
3. Replace ConfigHandler with MinimalConfigHandler
4. Update both providers to use new minimal config
5. Remove old config system and schemas

**Estimated Cleanup:** Remove 50+ files from config system

#### LLM Adapters (Selective)

**Keep:** Only adapters for LLM providers actually used
**Remove:** Unused provider adapters and their types

### Export Cleanup (Low Effort, High Impact)

Remove 228 unused exports by:

1. Making language objects in AutocompleteLanguageInfo private
2. Removing unused config schemas
3. Removing unused LLM adapter types
4. Removing unused utility functions
5. Removing unused NextEdit type definitions
