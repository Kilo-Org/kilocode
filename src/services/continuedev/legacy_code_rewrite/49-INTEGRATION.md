# ContinueDev Integration Documentation

## Overview

The ContinueDev project (Continue's autocomplete & NextEdit library) has been integrated into the Kilocode monorepo as an independent npm package within the services directory.

**Location**: `src/services/continuedev/`

**Integration Approach**: Hybrid - continuedev maintains its own tooling while being integrated into Kilocode's build pipeline via Turbo.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. ESLint Configuration

**Parent ESLint** ([`src/eslint.config.mjs`](../../eslint.config.mjs:40)):

- Added `services/continuedev/**` to ignores to prevent ESLint v9 from processing ESLint v8 config

**ContinueDev ESLint** ([`.eslintignore`](.eslintignore)):

- Created ignore file for problematic legacy files (`llamaTokenizer.js`, `eslint.config.js`)
- Maintains independent ESLint 8 configuration

### 2. TypeScript Configuration

**Parent TypeScript** ([`src/tsconfig.json`](../../tsconfig.json:24)):

- Added `services/continuedev/**` to exclude list
- Prevents main project's TypeScript from processing continuedev's `tsgo` code

**ContinueDev TypeScript** ([`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json)):

- Uses `@typescript/native-preview` (tsgo) - a faster TypeScript compiler
- Maintains separate configuration independent from main project

### 3. Turbo Integration

**Turbo Tasks** ([`turbo.json`](../../../turbo.json:51-71)):
Added four continuedev-specific tasks:

```json
"continuedev:lint": {
  "cache": true,
  "inputs": ["src/services/continuedev/**/*.ts", "src/services/continuedev/**/*.js", ...]
},
"continuedev:typecheck": {
  "cache": true,
  "inputs": ["src/services/continuedev/**/*.ts", "src/services/continuedev/tsconfig.json"]
},
"continuedev:test": {
  "cache": true,
  "dependsOn": ["continuedev:typecheck"],
  "inputs": ["src/services/continuedev/core/**/*.ts", ...]
},
"continuedev:format": {
  "cache": false
}
```

**Parent Task Dependencies** ([`turbo.json`](../../../turbo.json:3-8)):

- `lint` depends on `continuedev:lint`
- `check-types` depends on `continuedev:typecheck`
- `test` depends on `continuedev:test`

**Result**: Running `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check-types`, or `pnpm test` from root now automatically includes continuedev!

### 4. Package Scripts

**Root Scripts** ([`package.json`](../../../package.json:42-45)):

```json
"continuedev:install": "cd src/services/continuedev && npm install",
"continuedev:lint": "cd src/services/continuedev && npm run lint",
"continuedev:typecheck": "cd src/services/continuedev && npm run typecheck",
"continuedev:test": "cd src/services/continuedev && npm run test"
```

**Install Integration** ([`package.json`](../../../package.json:11)):

- `install:all` now runs `pnpm continuedev:install` after main install
- Ensures continuedev dependencies are always available

---

## Usage

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Install all dependencies including continuedev
pnpm install:all

# Or install continuedev separately
pnpm continuedev:install
```

### Development Workflow

#### Lint Everything (Including ContinueDev)

```bash
pnpm lint  # Runs parent lint + continuedev:lint via turbo
```

#### TypeCheck Everything (Including ContinueDev)

```bash
pnpm check-types  # Runs parent typecheck + continuedev:typecheck via turbo
```

#### Test Everything (Including ContinueDev)

```bash
pnpm test  # Runs parent tests + continuedev:test via turbo
```

#### Work with ContinueDev Only

```bash
# Lint only continuedev
pnpm continuedev:lint

# TypeCheck only continuedev
pnpm continuedev:typecheck

# Test only continuedev (857 tests)
pnpm continuedev:test

# Format continuedev code
cd src/services/continuedev && npm run format
```

---

## Test Results

### ContinueDev Tests

- **Total Tests**: 857 tests in 45 test files
- **Status**: ✅ All passing
- **Duration**: ~8 seconds
- **Framework**: Vitest 3.1.4

### Integration Verification

```bash
# All these now pass ✅
pnpm run lint           # Parent + continuedev lint
pnpm run check-types    # Parent + continuedev typecheck
pnpm continuedev:test   # ContinueDev tests only
```

---

## Architecture

### Independent Package Structure

```
src/services/continuedev/
├── package.json          # Independent npm package
├── package-lock.json     # npm lockfile (not pnpm)
├── node_modules/         # Separate dependencies
├── tsconfig.json         # Uses tsgo compiler
├── eslint.config.js      # ESLint 8 flat config
├── .eslintignore         # Ignore problematic files
├── core/                 # Main codebase
│   ├── autocomplete/     # Autocomplete feature
│   ├── nextEdit/         # NextEdit feature
│   ├── llm/              # LLM integrations
│   └── vscode-test-harness/  # VSCode integration tests
└── tree-sitter/          # Tree-sitter grammar files
```

### Why Independent?

1. **Different Package Manager**: continuedev uses npm, Kilocode uses pnpm
2. **Different TypeScript Compiler**: continuedev uses tsgo, Kilocode uses tsc
3. **Different ESLint Version**: continuedev uses v8, Kilocode uses v9
4. **Origin**: Extracted from Continue project with established tooling

### Integration Points

- **Build**: Via Turbo task dependencies
- **Lint**: Excluded from parent, runs separately via turbo
- **TypeCheck**: Excluded from parent, runs separately via turbo
- **Tests**: Run via turbo as part of overall test suite

## Known Issues & Warnings

### Node Version Warning

```
WARN  Unsupported engine: wanted: {"node":"20.19.2"} (current: {"node":"v22.16.0","pnpm":"10.8.1"})
```

**Impact**: None - Node 22.x is fully compatible despite the warning.

**Fix Options**:

1. Update continuedev's [`package.json`](package.json:55) engines to `"node": ">=20.19.0"`
2. Ignore the warning (current approach)

### ESLint Warnings in ContinueDev

The continuedev codebase currently has some ESLint warnings that are ignored via [`.eslintignore`](.eslintignore):

- Generator functions without yield
- Undefined globals in legacy JavaScript files
- Empty interfaces

**Status**: These warnings don't block builds and can be fixed incrementally.

---

## Future Improvements

### Short Term

1. Fix remaining ESLint warnings in continuedev code
2. Update Node version requirement to allow 22.x
3. Consider adding continuedev format to parent format command

### Medium Term

1. Evaluate migrating from npm to pnpm for continuedev
2. Consider upgrading to ESLint 9 (requires config migration)
3. Add continuedev to VS Code launch configurations for debugging

### Long Term

1. Evaluate using standard tsc instead of tsgo (simplifies tooling)
2. Consider creating shared TypeScript types package
3. Fully integrate into pnpm workspace (would require significant refactoring)

---

## Troubleshooting

### continuedev tests fail

```bash
cd src/services/continuedev
npm install  # Ensure dependencies are fresh
npm test     # Run directly to see full output
```

### continuedev lint fails on parent lint

```bash
# Verify continuedev is properly excluded
cat src/eslint.config.mjs | grep continuedev
# Should show: ignores: ["webview-ui", "out", "services/continuedev/**"]
```

### TypeScript errors from continuedev

```bash
# Verify continuedev is properly excluded
cat src/tsconfig.json | grep continuedev
# Should show: "exclude": ["node_modules", "services/continuedev/**"]
```

### Missing node_modules in continuedev

```bash
# Install continuedev dependencies
pnpm continuedev:install
# Or
cd src/services/continuedev && npm install
```

## Integration Checklist

When making changes to continuedev:

- [ ] Run `pnpm continuedev:test` to verify tests pass
- [ ] Run `pnpm continuedev:lint` to check for new lint issues
- [ ] Run `pnpm continuedev:typecheck` to verify types
- [ ] If adding dependencies, run `npm install` in continuedev directory
- [ ] Document significant changes in continuedev's own README.md

When changing build system:

- [ ] Verify continuedev tasks still work after turbo.json changes
- [ ] Test that `pnpm lint/check-types/test` still includes continuedev
- [ ] Check that continuedev exclusions remain in eslint/tsconfig

## Summary

The continuedev project is now fully integrated into Kilocode's build system:

✅ **Builds**: Automatically included via `pnpm install:all`  
✅ **Lints**: Runs independently via `pnpm lint` (turbo dependency)  
✅ **TypeChecks**: Runs independently via `pnpm check-types` (turbo dependency)  
✅ **Tests**: Runs independently via `pnpm test` (turbo dependency)  
✅ **Isolated**: Maintains own tooling without conflicts  
✅ **Cached**: Benefits from Turbo's caching system

You can now work with continuedev as part of your normal Kilocode development workflow!
