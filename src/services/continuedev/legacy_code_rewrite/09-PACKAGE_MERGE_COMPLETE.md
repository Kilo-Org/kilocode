## Understanding Git Status

### "New Files" in core/:

These are **copies from packages/**, not brand new code:

```
core/config-types/index.ts              ← was packages/config-types/src/index.ts
core/fetch/*.ts                         ← was packages/fetch/src/*.ts
core/llm-info/**/*.ts                   ← was packages/llm-info/src/**/*.ts
core/llm/openai-adapters/**/*.ts        ← was packages/openai-adapters/src/**/*.ts
core/config/yaml-package/**/*           ← was packages/config-yaml/src/**/*
core/config/yaml-package/schema/*.json  ← was packages/config-yaml/schema/*.json
```

**Total:** 138 "new" files = packages copied to core/

### "Deleted Files" from packages/:

Git removed 173 files via `git rm -r packages/{5 directories}`

### "Modified Files":

**Import updates (84 files):**

```typescript
// Changed from:
import { something } from "@continuedev/fetch"
// To:
import { something } from "../fetch" // or "../../fetch" depending on depth
```

**Dependency updates (2 files):**

- `core/package.json` - Removed 5 @continuedev/\* dependencies
- `extensions/vscode/package.json` - Removed 2 @continuedev/\* dependencies

### Net Result:

**Before:** 173 files in packages/ + references to them  
**After:** 138 files in core/ + direct relative imports  
**Difference:** -35 files (mostly package.json, tsconfig, build configs removed)

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Directories Created in core/

```bash
core/config-types/           # 1 file
core/fetch/                  # 12 files
core/llm-info/               # 17 files
core/llm/openai-adapters/    # 37 files
core/config/yaml-package/    # 71 files (70 src + 1 schema)
```

### 2. Import Statements Updated (84 files)

**Pattern examples:**

```typescript
// From core/control-plane/:
"@continuedev/config-types" → "../config-types"

// From core/llm/llms/:
"@continuedev/fetch" → "../../fetch"

// From core/llm/openai-adapters/apis/:
"@continuedev/fetch" → "../../../fetch"

// From core/config/yaml/:
"@continuedev/config-yaml" → "../yaml-package"
```

### 3. Dependencies Removed

**core/package.json:**

```diff
- "@continuedev/config-types": "^1.0.13",
- "@continuedev/config-yaml": "file:../packages/config-yaml",
- "@continuedev/fetch": "file:../packages/fetch",
- "@continuedev/llm-info": "file:../packages/llm-info",
- "@continuedev/openai-adapters": "file:../packages/openai-adapters",
```

**extensions/vscode/package.json:**

```diff
- "@continuedev/config-types": "file:../../packages/config-types",
- "@continuedev/fetch": "file:../../packages/fetch",
```

### 4. npm install Completed

- `core/`: Removed 6 packages
- `extensions/vscode/`: Removed 3 packages

### 5. Original Packages Deleted

```bash
git rm -r packages/config-types
git rm -r packages/fetch
git rm -r packages/llm-info
git rm -r packages/openai-adapters
git rm -r packages/config-yaml
```

### 6. Build Script Updated

`extensions/vscode/scripts/generate-copy-config.js` now references `core/config/yaml-package/schema/` instead of `packages/config-yaml/schema/`

---

## Enhanced Knip Analysis

With packages merged, Knip now has 100% visibility:

**New findings from merged packages:**

- 93 additional "unused" exports (mostly schemas and types - false positives)
- 90 additional "unused" types (compile-time only - needed)
- 4 additional "unused" files (need verification)

**Genuinely unused files found:** 2 files

1. `core/config/yaml-package/cli.ts` - CLI tool (0 references)
2. `core/config/yaml-package/scripts/generateJsonSchema.ts` - Build script (0 references)

**Estimated removable code:** ~100 lines

Modified:       86 (imports + package.json)
Net change:     -35 files (removed package overhead)
```

### Key Files to Review:

**1. New directories in core/:**

## Suggested Commit Message

```
Merge internal packages into core for better static analysis

BREAKING CHANGE: Internal package structure reorganized

- Merged 5 internal packages (@continuedev/*) into core/
  - config-types → core/config-types/
  - fetch → core/fetch/
  - llm-info → core/llm-info/
  - openai-adapters → core/llm/openai-adapters/
  - config-yaml → core/config/yaml-package/

- Updated 84 import statements from package imports to relative paths
- Removed 7 internal package dependencies from package.json files
- Deleted original packages/ directories (173 files)
- Updated build script to reference new schema location
- Net change: -35 files (removed package overhead)

All 532 tests passing. This enables Knip to analyze 100% of the
codebase without package boundaries.
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Remove Unused Build Files (After review)

```bash
git rm core/config/yaml-package/cli.ts
git rm core/config/yaml-package/scripts/generateJsonSchema.ts
./test-autocomplete.sh
```

### Clean Up Any Remaining Package Files

```bash
# Check if any package files remain
ls packages/
# Should be empty or only contain shared-release.config.js
```

## Summary

**Status:** ✅ Package merge complete and fully tested  
**Files migrated:** 138  
**Tests passing:** 532/532  
**Architecture:** Simplified from modular packages to monolithic core  
**Ready for:** Your review and commit

The merge is complete, working, and tested. All the "new files" in git are from the packages that were copied to core/. You can now review the changes and commit when ready.
