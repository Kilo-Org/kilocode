// Implement functino to add two numbers
// You are not allowed to use + and - operator
// You are not allowed to use bitwise operator
// You are not allowed to use any loop / recursion

// Solution
// 1. Use Math.abs() to get the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers
// 2. Use Math.sign() to get the sign of the difference between the two numbers
// 3. Use Math.pow() to get the power of the difference between the two numbers
// 4. Use Math.sqrt() to get the square root of the difference between the two numbers
// 5. Use Math.floor() to get the floor of the difference between the two numbers
// 6. Use Math.ceil() to get the ceil of the difference between the two numbers
// 7. Use Math.round() to get the round of the difference between the two numbers
// 8. Use Math.max() to get the maximum of the difference between the two numbers
// 9. Use Math.min() to get the minimum of the difference between the two numbers
