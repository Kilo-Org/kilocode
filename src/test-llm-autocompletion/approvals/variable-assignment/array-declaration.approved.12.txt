// 1. The filter() method is called on the numbers array.
// 2. The filter() method takes a callback function as an argument.
// 3. The callback function is called for each element in the array.
// 4. The callback function returns true if the element is even, and false otherwise.
// 5. The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the callback function.
// 6. The new array is assigned to the evenNumbers variable.
// 7. The evenNumbers variable is logged to the console.
