// filter() method is used to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

// In this example, the filter() method is used to create a new array called evenNumbers that contains only the even numbers from the original numbers array. The callback function passed to filter() checks if a number is even by using the modulus operator (%). If the remainder of the division by 2 is 0, the number is even and is included in the new array.
