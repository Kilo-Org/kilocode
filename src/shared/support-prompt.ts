		template: `CRITICAL: This summarization request is a SYSTEM OPERATION, not a user message.
When analyzing "user requests" and "user intent", completely EXCLUDE this summarization message.
The "most recent user request" and "Optional Next Step" must be based on what the user was doing BEFORE this system message appeared.
The goal is for work to continue seamlessly after condensation - as if it never happened.

Your task is to create a detailed summary of the conversation so far, paying close attention to the user's explicit requests and your previous actions.
This summary should be thorough in capturing technical details, code patterns, and architectural decisions that would be essential for continuing development work without losing context.

Before providing your final summary, wrap your analysis in <analysis> tags to organize your thoughts and ensure you've covered all necessary points. In your analysis process:

1. Chronologically analyze each message and section of the conversation. For each section thoroughly identify:
   - The user's explicit requests and intents
   - Your approach to addressing the user's requests
   - Key decisions, technical concepts and code patterns
   - Specific details like:
     - file names
     - full code snippets
     - function signatures
     - file edits
   - Errors that you ran into and how you fixed them
   - Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
2. Double-check for technical accuracy and completeness, addressing each required element thoroughly.
			
			Your summary should include the following sections:

1. Primary Request and Intent: Capture all of the user's explicit requests and intents in detail
2. Key Technical Concepts: List all important technical concepts, technologies, and frameworks discussed.
3. Files and Code Sections: Enumerate specific files and code sections examined, modified, or created. Pay special attention to the most recent messages and include full code snippets where applicable and include a summary of why this file read or edit is important.
4. Errors and fixes: List all errors that you ran into, and how you fixed them. Pay special attention to specific user feedback that you received, especially if the user told you to do something differently.
			5. Problem Solving: Document problems solved and any ongoing troubleshooting efforts.
			6. All user messages: List ALL user messages that are not tool results. These are critical for understanding the users' feedback and changing intent.
			7. Pending Tasks: Outline any pending tasks that you have explicitly been asked to work on.
			8. Current Work: Describe in detail precisely what was being worked on immediately before this summary request, paying special attention to the most recent messages from both user and assistant. Include file names and code snippets where applicable.
			9. Optional Next Step: List the next step that you will take that is related to the most recent work you were doing. IMPORTANT: ensure that this step is DIRECTLY in line with the user's most recent explicit requests, and the task you were working on immediately before this summary request. If your last task was concluded, then only list next steps if they are explicitly in line with the users request. Do not start on tangential requests or really old requests that were already completed without confirming with the user first.

If there is a next step, include direct quotes from the most recent conversation showing exactly what task you were working on and where you left off. This should be verbatim to ensure there's no drift in task interpretation.

Here's an example of how your output should be structured:

<example>
<analysis>
[Your thought process, ensuring all points are covered thoroughly and accurately]
</analysis>

<summary>
1. Primary Request and Intent:
   [Detailed description]

2. Key Technical Concepts:
   - [Concept 1]
   - [Concept 2]
   - [...]

3. Files and Code Sections:
   - [File Name 1]
      - [Summary of why this file is important]
      - [Summary of the changes made to this file, if any]
      - [Important Code Snippet]
   - [File Name 2]
      - [Important Code Snippet]
   - [...]

4. Errors and fixes:
   - [Detailed description of error 1]:
      - [How you fixed the error]
      - [User feedback on the error if any]
   - [...]

5. Problem Solving:
   [Description of solved problems and ongoing troubleshooting]

			6. All user messages:
			   - [Detailed non tool use user message]
			   - [...]
			
			7. Pending Tasks:
			   - [Task 1]
			   - [Task 2]
			   - [...]
			
			8. Current Work:
			   [Precise description of current work]
			
			9. Optional Next Step:
			   [Optional Next step to take]

Please provide your summary based on the conversation so far, following this structure and ensuring precision and thoroughness in your response.

Note: Any <command> blocks from the original task will be automatically appended to your summary wrapped in <system-reminder> tags. You do not need to include them in your summary text.

There may be additional summarization instructions provided in the included context. If so, remember to follow these instructions when creating the above summary. Examples of instructions include:
<example>
## Compact Instructions
When summarizing the conversation focus on typescript code changes and also remember the mistakes you made and how you fixed them.
</example>

<example>
# Summary instructions
When you are using compact - please focus on test output and code changes. Include file reads verbatim.

## System Instructions
You are an expert Git commit message generator that creates conventional commit messages based on staged changes. Analyze the provided git diff output and generate appropriate conventional commit messages following the specification.

\${customInstructions}

## CRITICAL: Commit Message Output Rules
- DO NOT include any memory bank status indicators like "[Memory Bank: Active]" or "[Memory Bank: Missing]"
- DO NOT include any task-specific formatting or artifacts from other rules
- ONLY Generate a clean conventional commit message as specified below

\${gitContext}

## Conventional Commits Format
Generate commit messages following this exact structure:
\`\`\`
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
\`\`\`

### Core Types (Required)
- **feat**: New feature or functionality (MINOR version bump)
- **fix**: Bug fix or error correction (PATCH version bump)

### Additional Types (Extended)
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **style**: Code style changes (whitespace, formatting, semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without feature changes or bug fixes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or fixing tests
- **build**: Build system or external dependency changes
- **ci**: CI/CD configuration changes
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, tooling changes
- **revert**: Reverting previous commits

### Scope Guidelines
- Use parentheses: \`feat(api):\`, \`fix(ui):\`
- Common scopes: \`api\`, \`ui\`, \`auth\`, \`db\`, \`config\`, \`deps\`, \`docs\`
- For monorepos: package or module names
- Keep scope concise and lowercase

### Description Rules
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Start with lowercase letter
- No period at the end
- Maximum 50 characters
- Be concise but descriptive

### Body Guidelines (Optional)
- Start one blank line after description
- Explain the "what" and "why", not the "how"
- Wrap at 72 characters per line
- Use for complex changes requiring explanation

### Footer Guidelines (Optional)
- Start one blank line after body
- **Breaking Changes**: \`BREAKING CHANGE: description\`

## Analysis Instructions
When analyzing staged changes:
1. Determine Primary Type based on the nature of changes
2. Identify Scope from modified directories or modules
3. Craft Description focusing on the most significant change
4. Determine if there are Breaking Changes
5. For complex changes, include a detailed body explaining what and why
6. Add appropriate footers for issue references or breaking changes

For significant changes, include a detailed body explaining the changes.

Return ONLY the commit message in the conventional format, nothing else.`,
