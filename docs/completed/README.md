**Key Achievements**:

- 167/167 tests passing
- Memory optimized with bounded resource usage
- Professional code quality with comprehensive documentation
- Clean integration with Ghost system architecture

### [Ghost System Overhaul](./ghost-system-overhaul-summary.md)

**Status**: Major Enhancement Complete ‚úÖ  
**Completion Date**: 2025-01-29

Comprehensive overhaul of the Ghost autocomplete system introducing four major new capabilities while maintaining complete backward compatibility:

1. **üîÑ Dual Display System** - Hybrid inline + decorator rendering
2. **‚ö° Advanced Caching** - Responsive "type-into" functionality
3. **üìù Template System** - Handlebars-based prompt strategies
4. **üìä Enhanced Benchmarking** - Comprehensive strategy evaluation

**Key Achievements**:

- Evolution without revolution - significant expansion without replacement
- Competitive feature parity with GitHub Copilot's inline experience
- Performance advantage through intelligent caching
- Data-driven optimization through comprehensive benchmarking

## Impact Summary

These two major projects transformed Kilo Code from a basic autocomplete system to a sophisticated, multi-modal AI coding assistant with:

- **Advanced AI Integration**: Mercury Coder for complex scenarios
