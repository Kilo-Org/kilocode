# Architecture Documentation

This section contains documentation about the high-level architecture and design of the
Kilo Code system.

## Contents

- [Overview](./overview.md) - High-level system architecture and component
  relationships
- [Extension Lifecycle](./extension-lifecycle.md) - VS Code extension activation
  and lifecycle management
- [Webview Communication](./webview-communication.md) - Communication patterns
  between extension and webview
- [Data Flow](./data-flow.md) - Data flow diagrams and state management patterns

## Architecture Principles

The Kilo Code architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Clear boundaries between extension core, UI, and services
2. **Modularity** - Components are designed to be independent and reusable
3. **Testability** - Architecture supports comprehensive testing at all levels
4. **Performance** - Optimized for VS Code extension performance requirements
5. **Maintainability** - Code organization supports long-term maintenance and evolution
