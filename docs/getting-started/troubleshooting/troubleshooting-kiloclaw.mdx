# KiloClaw Troubleshooting

## OpenClaw Runtime Layer

Issues originating from the OpenClaw environment.

### Typical symptoms

- Agent execution halts or crashes
- Tool invocation errors
- Automation/cron execution issues
- UI rendering or session state problems

**The Heartbeat Check:** Look for `heartbeat` events in the logs. If you see these, the OpenClaw Gateway is alive.

Check the [OpenClaw Troubleshooting docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/help/troubleshooting) for a deep dive on OpenClaw errors.

## Changelog

Kilo Claw has a changelog on its deploy/instance page that displays recent changes to the platform.

### Entry types

Each changelog entry is labeled with one of the following categories:

- **Features** — New capabilities or enhancements added to the platform.
- **Bug fixes** — Corrections to existing behavior.

### Redeploy badges

Changelog entries may also carry an optional badge indicating whether a redeploy is needed:

- **Redeploy Required** — You must redeploy your instance to take full advantage of the change. Without redeploying, the change will not apply.
- **Redeploy Suggested** — A redeploy is recommended to get the most out of the change, but it is not strictly necessary. The change may partially apply without redeploying.
