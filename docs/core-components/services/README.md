# Service Layer Architecture

This directory contains documentation for the service layer components located in
`src/services/`. The service layer provides specialized functionality and integrations that support
the core extension features, including browser automation, code indexing, search capabilities, and
external service integrations.

## Directory Structure

- [MCP Integration](./mcp.md) - Model Context Protocol server management
- [Browser Services](./browser.md) - Browser automation and web content fetching
- [Search Services](./search.md) - File and code search capabilities
- [Checkpoint Services](./checkpoints.md) - Task state management and versioning
- [Code Index Services](./code-index.md) - Code analysis and indexing
- [Tree-sitter Services](./tree-sitter.md) - Code parsing and syntax analysis

## Service Architecture Principles

### Dependency Injection

Services are designed to be loosely coupled and injectable:

- Services receive dependencies through constructor injection
- Interfaces define service contracts
- Mock implementations available for testing

### Lifecycle Management

Services follow consistent lifecycle patterns:

- **Initialization**: Setup and configuration
- **Connection**: Establish external connections
- **Operation**: Provide core functionality
- **Cleanup**: Resource disposal and cleanup

### Error Handling

Standardized error handling across services:

- Graceful degradation when services unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging and reporting
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms where appropriate

### Configuration Management

Services integrate with the configuration system:

- User-configurable settings
- Environment-specific configurations
- Runtime configuration updates
- Validation and schema enforcement

## Key Service Categories

### Integration Services

Services that connect to external systems:

- **MCP Hub**: Manages Model Context Protocol servers
- **Browser Session**: Controls browser automation
- **Git Integration**: Version control operations
- **Marketplace**: Extension marketplace integration

### Analysis Services

Services that analyze and process code:

- **Code Index**: Semantic code analysis and search
- **Tree-sitter**: Syntax parsing and AST generation
- **Autocomplete**: Code completion suggestions
- **Ghost**: AI-powered code suggestions

### Infrastructure Services

Services that provide core infrastructure:

- **Search**: File and content search
- **Checkpoints**: State management and versioning
- **Glob**: File system operations
- **Ripgrep**: Fast text search

### Utility Services

Services that provide specialized utilities:

- **Commit Message**: AI-generated commit messages
- **MDM**: Mobile device management
- **Roo Config**: Configuration management

## Service Communication Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

Services communicate through events:

```typescript
// Service emits events
service.emit("statusChanged", { status: "connected" })

// Other components listen
service.on("statusChanged", (event) => {
	// Handle status change
})
```

### Promise-Based APIs

Asynchronous operations use promises:

```typescript
// Service method returns promise
async searchFiles(query: string): Promise<FileResult[]> {
  // Implementation
}

// Consumers await results
const results = await searchService.searchFiles('*.ts')
```

### Callback Patterns

Some services use callbacks for streaming data:

```typescript
// Service accepts callback for streaming results
service.search(query, (result) => {
	// Handle streaming result
})
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategies

Services implement various caching mechanisms:

- **In-memory caching**: Fast access to frequently used data
- **Persistent caching**: Disk-based caching for expensive operations
- **Cache invalidation**: Automatic cache updates when data changes

### Resource Management

Services manage resources efficiently:

- **Connection pooling**: Reuse expensive connections
- **Lazy initialization**: Initialize services only when needed
- **Resource cleanup**: Proper disposal of resources

### Optimization Techniques

- **Debouncing**: Prevent excessive API calls
- **Throttling**: Limit resource consumption
- **Batching**: Group operations for efficiency
- **Streaming**: Handle large datasets incrementally

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Each service includes comprehensive unit tests:

- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions
- Verify configuration handling
- Performance testing

### Integration Testing

Services are tested together:

- End-to-end workflows
- Service interaction patterns
- Configuration integration
- Error propagation

### Mock Services

Mock implementations for testing:

- Predictable behavior
- Configurable responses
- Error simulation
- Performance testing

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

Services implement proper access control:

- Authentication where required
- Authorization checks
- Resource access validation
- Audit logging

### Data Protection

Services protect sensitive data:

- Secure credential storage
- Data encryption in transit
- Sanitization of user input
- Privacy compliance

### Network Security

Network-based services implement security measures:

- TLS/SSL encryption
- Certificate validation
- Request signing
- Rate limiting

## Future Enhancements

- **Service mesh**: Advanced service communication
- **Health monitoring**: Service health checks and monitoring
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic service scaling based on load
- **Circuit breakers**: Fault tolerance patterns
- **Distributed tracing**: Request tracing across services
